Output:

Fibonacci series is 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 

Explanation:
1.  It declares and initializes variables n, i, a, b, and c. n stores the number of terms entered by the user. i is used as a loop counter. a and b represent the first two terms of the Fibonacci series, and c is used to calculate the next term.

2.  The code prompts the user to enter the number of terms using the printf and scanf functions.

3.  It then starts a for loop that iterates from 1 to n, inclusive. This loop is used to generate and print each term of the Fibonacci series.

4.  Inside the loop, the code prints the current value of a, which represents the current term in the series, using the printf function.

5.  It then calculates the next term of the series by adding a and b and assigns it to c.

6.  The values of a and b are updated to prepare for the next iteration of the loop. a is assigned the current value of b, and b is assigned the current value of c.

7.  The loop continues to generate the subsequent terms until the loop counter i reaches the value of n.

8.  Once the loop finishes executing, the program ends by returning 0.

   The output of this program will be the Fibonacci series with the number of terms specified by the user. Each term will be separated by a space.
