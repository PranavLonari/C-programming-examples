#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
 int n,i=1,a=0,b=1,c;
 printf("enter no.of terms\n");
 scanf("%d",&n);

    printf("%d ",a);
    c=a+b;
    a=b;

}

Output:

Fibonacci series is 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 

Explanation:
1. The program asks the user to enter the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci series.

2. It then starts a loop that will generate and print the Fibonacci series.

3. Inside the loop, it prints the current number (a) of the Fibonacci series.

4. It calculates the next number in the series by adding the current number (a) and the previous number (b), and stores it in c.

5. It updates the values of a and b to prepare for the next iteration of the loop. a becomes the previous number (b), and b becomes the current number (c).

6. The loop continues until it has generated and printed the desired number of terms specified by the user.

7. Finally, the program ends.

   So, the program essentially asks the user for a number, then generates and prints that many terms of the Fibonacci series. Each term is obtained by adding the two previous terms, starting with 0 and 1
